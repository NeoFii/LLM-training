## 📊 Experiment Tracking

This project uses [SwanLab](https://swanlab.cn/) for experiment tracking and visualization. All training processes and metric changes are fully recorded.
```python
import swanlab

# Initialize experiment
swanlab.init(
    project="llm-training-learning",
    experiment_name="chapter2-pretrain"
)
```
